# Introduction
Are you a sports freak you wants to make highlights of your plays? Youtube clips is great for catching all your highlights, but there is no tooling to make a highlight reel. Introducing this script that does exactly that, all with pure python and no API access required.

## How to use
You need to install python and recommend making an environment with the `requirements.txt`. You can do that with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then make a text file called `clip_urls.txt` and each line in that text file is a link to the Youtube clip. Then just run the `main.py` script. Happy highlights!
